swerc - a minimalist document management system
-----------------------------------------------

swerc is simple werc, a fork of Uriel's werc at: http://werc.cat-v.org/

Installation
------------

Requirements:

* An http server that can handle CGIs
* Plan 9 from User Space: http://plan9.us - Or http://tools.suckless.org/9base

Note: swerc by default expects the Plan 9 tools to be installed under
/usr/local/plan9/bin/, if you have installed them elsewhere you will need to
edit the #! line in bin/werc.rc and customize the $plan9port variable in your
etc/initrc.local.


Instructions:

Untar swerc at your desired location, configure httpd to use
/path-to-your-werc-installation/bin/werc.rc as a cgi-script, it is recommended
that you make werc.rc handle all non-static files (this can be done by setting
it up as your 404 handler) and setup your virtual hosts to handle static files
by setting the document root for the domain to
/path-to-werc-installation/sites/yourdomain.com/, and create a directory for
your web site under sites/ where you can start adding content right away.

If you will want to allow updates via the web interface (eg., for wiki or
comments apps) make sure all files under sites/ are writable by the user your
cgi will run as, usually www-data, for example by doing: chown -R :www-data
sites/; chmod -R g+w sites/

If your Plan 9 from User Space installation is located somewhere else than the
standard /usr/local/plan9/ you will need to edit the first line of bin/werc.rc
(Note that p9p is picky about where it is located, once you run ./INSTALL you
should *not* move it to a different directory without running ./INSTALL again.)

For general configuration edit etc/initrc.
Site (and directory) specific options can be set in a
sites/example.com/_werc/config file inside the site's directory.
